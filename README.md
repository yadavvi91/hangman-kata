# Hangman Refactoring Kata

This is a refactoring code kata where the code used over here https://legalizeadulthood.wordpress.com/2018/10/28/refactoring-the-long-game/ has been further refactored.

(YouTube Link - [Refactoring: The Long Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0MeoFTj6DU) )

In the video, the code has been refactored to make it testable.

I have added Characterization Tests/Approval Tests to the code refactored above _without_ using any ApprovalsTest Framework like [ApprovalTests.Java](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Java)

I have further refactored the code to apply design patterns.

The Refactorings used are from **Martin Fowler: Refactoring** and **Joshua Kerievsky: Refactoring to Patterns** books.

I have used `Chain Of Responsibility` pattern, inspired by [Emily Bache's](https://twitter.com/emilybache) Tennis Game Refactoring Kata - https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata (especially the [Chain Of Responsibility](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/java/src/main/java/TennisGame4.java) implementation)
